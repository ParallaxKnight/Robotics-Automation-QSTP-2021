# Week I: Unicycle
Welcome to Automation for Robotics Automation using ROS!

The first week has three main goals -
1) Setting up a proper development environment for working with ROS. 
2) Learning the basics of python. 
3) Getting familiar with the tools you will need for the course. 

The resources for this week can be found [here](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/QSTP_Robot-Automation-using-ROS_2021/blob/main/WEEK%201/RESOURCES.md).

If you face any difficulty in completing the following tasks, please feel free to contact the team.

## Assignment
Kinematic models of robots approximate their behaviour given various control commands. For example, given a control command `(v, w)` i.e linear and angular velocity to a robot in a state `(x, y, theta)`, the robot behaviour after applying the command can be approximated using the kinematics model of a robot.

Unicycle model is the simplest there exists to approximate the behaviour of a differential drive Robot. Refer to [this](http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node660.html) resource to take a look at the equations in general

## Logistics
1. There is a python file accompanying this assignment. You have to complete some of the functions and plot the trajectory using `matplotlib`. [[Assignment](unicycle.py)].
2. Details regarding the submission, deadline etc. are updated in the Google Classroom.
